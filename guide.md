# Instructor guide


## Optional sections

For a complete beginner exposed to version control the half day schedule is too
dense. The sections "Using the Git staging area" and "Git under the hood" can
be skipped if time is tight. "Using the Git staging area" can also be given as
a homework assignment.  The short section "Remotes and GitHub" is here because
we are exposed to GitHub in another lesson on the same afternoon. Otherwise it
can be skipped or moved to another module.
