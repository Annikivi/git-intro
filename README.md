assumed to be the very first thing done

The lesson Jekyll file structure and browsing layout is inspired by and derived from
work by [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) licensed under the

We have kept the YAML structure in the episode Markdown files for future compatibility
but have heavily cut down and modified the layout and include files.

## ToDo

* if possible bring the challenges over from software carpentry, they look cool. Are they specialized markdown, though?
* determine what other features we could use
