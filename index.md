# Introduction to version control with Git

This lesson will teach students the basics of the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
version control system.


## Prerequisites

1. Students should have installed the latest or a reasonably new version of
   git on their machines. For installation instructions and binaries see 
   [the git home page](https://git-scm.com/).

2. Students should have some version of Python installed. This will be already
   installed on \*nix systems. For Windows users we recommend installing the
   latest Python 3 release from
   [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

3. Students are expected to be familiar with using the command line. No
   expertise is required, but the lesson will be mostly taken from the command
   line.

4. Students should be familiar with using a text editor on their system. Emacs
   and Vim are excellent choices if you know how to use them but Nano or
   Notepad on Windows are sufficient.

5. Git should be configured prior to the lesson following [our installation instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/).


## Notes

If you are interested in the Git-aware prompt you can find it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jimeh/git-aware-prompt).

In this introduction we will mention and use [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow
similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With
this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
[GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of
concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is
currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high
that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you
choose to host your Git repository on another platform.
