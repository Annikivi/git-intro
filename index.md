# Introduction to version control with Git

This lesson will teach students the basics of the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
version control system. The guacamole example that we use is inspired by
[Byron Smith](http://blog.byronjsmith.com), for original reference, see
[this thread](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss/2016-May/004529.html).


## Prerequisites

- A reasonably recent version of Git is installed. For installation
  instructions and binaries see [the Git home page](https://git-scm.com/).
- Being comfortable with the command line. No expertise is required, but the
  lesson will be mostly taken from the command line.
- Students should be familiar with using a text editor on their system. Emacs
  and Vim are excellent choices if you know how to use them but Nano or Notepad
  on Windows are sufficient.
- Git should be configured prior to the lesson following [our installation instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/).


## Notes

If you are interested in the Git-aware prompt you can find it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jimeh/git-aware-prompt).

In this introduction we will mention and use [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow
similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With
this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
[GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of
concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is
currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high
that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you
choose to host your Git repository on another platform.
